																	<strong>Why is my husband talking to his ex</strong>. 
								
																	You wont tell him he cant talk to his exes but in exchange he has to quit being secretive about it and not spend TOO much time at it. 
																	If your husband talks to your ex without any valid reasons or finds excuses to talk to her then there is definitely something fishy. 
																	If he is talking about his ex all the time that is a quick and easy way to tell that he really misses her. 
																	He has his own reasons why he cant let go of his ex. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	On the flip side if your partner is really. 
																	He is still talking to his ex and its possible they may get back together. 
																	This is human and often part of someones grieving process. 
																	The only thing you can control is whether you tolerate it or not. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	There shouldnt be a reason for him to talk about his ex although mentioning her once in a blue moon is okay. 
																	She says that you also have a right to be worried if your SO. 
																	Its because of these problems I never prever a partner who has past relationships in life. 
																	As Graber says The obvious sign of your partner hoarding feelings for their ex may be a case of verbal diarrhea when it comes to talking about them.

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Is talking to an ex just as frequently or more frequently than they talk to you. 
																	Be smart and be careful. 
																	Greater longing for an ex is associated with decreases in satisfaction with your current partner over time and decreases in satisfaction over.

																	I wrote this article in response to a guys email where he writes that he is still talking to his ex girlfriend. 
																	In her experience most healthy relationships with. 
																	Either way he is the one who ultimately has control over this. 
																	Certainly I do. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It is often easier to tell a bystander the truth about any given situation as opposed to someone who might actually be impacted by the truth see. 
																	Simply put people talk about whats on their mind. 
																	David my second husband married again after we split up. 
																	HE TALKS ABOUT HER NON-STOP. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The title of this article isnt referring to an ex-wife or ex-husband You are most likely still talking to your ex wife or husband if you have kids. 
																	Dont let her put you in an unnecessary fights with your boyfriend. 
																	You must have been really surprise knowing that your boyfriend still talking to his ex. 
																	You would of course have to ask her how she regarded me all those years ago. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Dont Let Any Emotion Involved. 
																	Your husband most likely concealed this from you because he knew it would upset you. 
																	Not only do people enjoy talking to an ex-partner because of this shared history but often it can be easier to talk to an ex-partner because they are less involved in what is currently going on. 
																	It creates a sense of being understoodthat someone knows you and gets you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you try to forbid him from talking to his ex whether it is justified or you are just acting out of insecurity you are fighting a losing battle. 
																	Its not exactly fair to expect him to completely shut his ex out of his lifeunless shes very clearly still warm for his formbecause thats not cool. 
																	Even if he isnt saying very nice things about her he is still talking about her which isnt a good sign. 
																	Indeed he is still with his wife Karin. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Unsatisfied with his explanations for his behavior I tried to find other reasons. 
																	My husband and I have been fighting a lot over the past week or so which is really abnormal for our relationship. 
																	I dont know if your guy is fixated on his ex or not because I dont know the timetable. 
																	Um probably because he misses her. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Therefore if your boyfriend or partner still has some stuff from his ex laying around here and there its a clear sign that he misses his ex-wife or ex-girlfriend. 
																	Its not always that he still has feelings linger for her. 
																	She was part of his life. 
																	Hes revisiting old memories. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Maybe you could even chat with them too and get to know them. 
																	But if theyre talking all the time its not. 
																	This aspect of his behavior his warmth commitment and generosity are probably the same traits that drew you to him. 
																	If you find that your boyfriend is telling you all about his ex why they broke up and what went wrong you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Longitudinal research suggests its a bit of both. 
																	Whatever you need to keep an eye on his actions and phone. 
																	People like to relive past memories and talk to someone they know. 
																	I looked on his Facebook and found that he has been talking to one of his ex-girlfriends one who turned down his proposal of marriage in fact on a very regular basis. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Perhaps the real issue stems from the fact that your husband concealed the truth about the amount of contact he has with former partners. 
																	Husband snapchatting other woman husband talking to ex girlfriend on facebook husband texting ex girlfriend my boyfriend talks to his ex girlfriend my husband texts another woman my husband texts female coworker my husband texts female friend my husband texts his ex girlfriend partner texting another woman. 
																	A man who is over his ex does not emotionally dwell on the past when hes with you.
